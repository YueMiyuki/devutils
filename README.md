# DevUtils: Your Swiss Army Knife for Modern Devs

This app is built with these two: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (and by ❤️) It’s sleek, it’s cross-platform, and it’s here to make your development life just a little bit more awesome

Whether you’re crunching timestamps, slinging JWTs, wrestling with regex, or just flexing your inner hacker—DevUtils has a tool for (almost) every dev situation. And if it doesn’t? PRs are _always_ welcome 😉.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Why Tauri and Next.js?**  
A: Because Electron is heavy and we value RAM. Also: Rust is rad.

**Q: I broke something, halp?**  
A: Open an issue! Bonus points for funny bug descriptions. We fix stuff quick (usually).

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: As much as any devtool built at midnight can be. Use it, break it, help it get better.
